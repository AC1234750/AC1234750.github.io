---| Term | Definition | Base Structure / Syntax | Real Life Example | App Example 
|      | A named container used to store a value that may change. | `var x = 5;` 
|      | A fixed value that cannot change once set. | `const PI = 3.14;` |  |  |
|      | The kind of value a variable holds, like numbers or text. | `int`, `String`, `bool` |  |  |
|      | A sequence of characters used to represent words or text. | `"Hello World"` |  |  |
|      | Whole number values. | `int age = 16;` |  |  |
|      | Number values with decimals. | `double age = 16.2;` |  |  |
|      | A value that can be true or false. | `bool isLoggedIn = false;` |  |  |
|      | A collection of values in a specific order. | `List<String> names = [];` |  |  |
|      | A special value that means “nothing.” | `String? name = null;` |  |  |
|      | A reusable block of code that performs an action. | `void sayHi() { print("Hi"); }` |  |  |
|      | The information passed into a function to change how it works. | `greet(String name)` |  |  |
|      | The result a function gives back. | `return total;` |  |  |
|      | Where a variable or function can be used. | (No set syntax— concept-based) |  |  |
|      | Blueprint for creating objects with specific structure and behavior. | `class Dog {}` |  |  |
|      | A specific version of a class. | `Dog myDog = Dog();` |  |  |
|      | A variable that belongs to a class/object. | `String name;` |  |  |
|      | A function that belongs to a class. | `void bark() {}` |  |  |
|      | A special function used to set up a class when it’s created. | `Dog(this.name);` |  |  |
|      | Hiding the inner workings of code so users only interact with what they need. | (Concept — not specific code) |  |  |
|      | Changing how a built-in or inherited function behaves. | `@override` |  |  |
|      | A function that does not return a value. | `void printMessage() {}` |  |

| scanner| creates a scanner object to take input from user | scanner in = new scanner (system.in); | | |
| import scanner | gives access to scanner class, required at top | import java.until.scanner; | | |
| print  line statment | primt what's in the parenthesis, adds line after | system.out.printin(" "); | | |
| print statement | prints the content in the parenthesis | system.out.print(" "); | | |
| input next | reads in a string from the user | input.nextLine(); | | | 
| input nextInt | reads in an int from the user | input.nextInt(); | | |
| input nextDouble | reads in a double (decimal) from the user | input.nextDouble(); | | |
| input nextBoolean | reads in a boolean (true/false) from the user |input.nextBoolean(); | | |
| Arithmetic operators |  -     *     /      %  (modulus, returns the reainder from dividing) |  |  |  |
| Compound operators (applies the result to the variable) | +=      -=      *=       /=      %=    ++ (adds  1)
